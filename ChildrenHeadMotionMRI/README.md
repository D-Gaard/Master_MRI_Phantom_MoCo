## Code used for analysing the data:
* `Matrix_Extraction.ipynb`: calculates and saves the transformation matrices for each time point in RAS space
* `Motion_Patterns.ipynb`: uses the matrices extracted with Matrix_Extraction.ipynb to analyse motion patterns
* `functions.py`: utility functions used in the Jupyter notebooks Matrix_Extraction.ipynb and Motion_Patterns.ipynb
